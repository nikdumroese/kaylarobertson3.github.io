### Creative Coding Final project

In this simple scatterplot, I further learned to clean and enter data, expand on HTML and CSS, and get a solid introduction into D3.

I based off of a demonstration from the 2016 NICAR conference by By Chris Canipe and Jon McClure.

I compiled a small dataset of colleges in Montana using data from the Montana University System, and projected points onto a scatterplot using D3.

The results of the graph weren't as drastic as I had in mind animation-wise, but from start to finish I learned quite a bit about the basics of D3, and will be able to delve deeper into more complex charts with the next project.
