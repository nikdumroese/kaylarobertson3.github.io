#Final project proposal

I want to make an interactive infographic using a dataset for my final project. While I'm still deciding on the exact data set, I'm leaning toward something like https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/airlines/airlines.json of airplane delays by airport.

I want to display the data overtime, and have an option for the user to click on any airport, or all airports, from a dropdown menu, which would display the selected data on a line chart timeline.

An example of a similar, although much more in-dpth project, is the baby name graphic from Visual Cinnamon: http://www.visualcinnamon.com/babynamesus. Although this uses d3 and I will be only using p5, html and css.

The main part will be this interactive line chart with tooltips of data points. Other smaller charts I also want to make to show interesting points of the data could be:
pie chart of delay percentages by season, that would change with airport and with year drop dropdown
Reasons for delay: icons of snow, rain, mechanical failure that show up depending on reason
Total minutes of delays by airport overall, by airport each day, or by day alone.
Worst days to fly
Worst states to fly out of, etc.

##Sub-problems:
Drop down menus
  -multiple charts on one canvas, too many if/thens basically

##Work schedule:
-Start soon
-Finish by December 12!
