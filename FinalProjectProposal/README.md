#Final project proposal

I want to make an interactive infographic using a dataset for my final project. While I'm still deciding on the exact data set, I'm leaning toward something like https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/airlines/airlines.json of airplane delays by airport.

I want to display the data overtime, and have an option for the user to click on any airport, or all airports, from a dropdown menu, which would display the selected data on a line chart timeline.

An example of a similar, although much more in-dpth project, is the baby name graphic from Visual Cinnamon: http://www.visualcinnamon.com/babynamesus. Although this uses d3 and I will be only using p5, html and css.

The main part will be this interactive line chart with tooltips of data points. Other smaller charts I also want to make to show interesting points of the data could be:

* pie chart of delay percentages by season, that would change with airport and with year drop dropdown
* Reasons for delay: icons of snow, rain, mechanical failure that show up depending on reason
* Total minutes of delays by airport overall, by airport each day, or by day alone.
* Worst days to fly
* Worst states to fly out of, etc.

##Sub-problems:
* Drop down menus
* multiple charts on one canvas, too many if/thens basically

##Work schedule:
* Start soon
* Finish by December 12!
